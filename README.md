Over the course of Advanced Web Apps, a UF course that succinctly beat back-end coding into me, I became something of the Department of Corrections beat reporter. 

I don't regret it. It's  a topic that interests me and one I plan to continue analyzing in the future, potentially starting an Innoence Project at UF. But my professor can atest to the fact that I often have more ideas than hours in the day. 

This project was no exception. For my final project, I started off wanting to build a Flask app of potential discreprancies in Florida's sentencing, highlighting about 150 prisoners. After fighting with a 2 GB Access file for a week and finally winning, at 2:30 one morning I decided to switch to showing the faces of Florida's death row. I was inspired by the Texas Tribune's <a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/death-row/">project</a>. 

Why would I switch from a non-scraping Access project to a scraping project?

A few reasons: 
<ul>
<li>I will complain endlessly about scraping, but the truth is I love it. As I never got into Hogwarts, it's the closest thing to magic I've seen.</li>
<li>I like doing data stories, but to truly analyze ever discreprancy in the state's sentencing would have been a massive undertaking for a few weeks and between school and work, it wasn't feasible. The last thing I wanted was to produce was a half-finished project.</li>
</ul>

With that said, I had hoped to make this app filterable. I will likely still try and do this in the next few days to show death row inmates by race, county of crime committed and time on death row.
